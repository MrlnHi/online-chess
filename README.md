## Launch
To launch and try it out, you need to first start the backend and then start the frontend in a different console window.

### Launch backend
```
cargo r -p backend
```

### Launch frontend
```
cd /crates/frontend
trunk serve
```
you can optionally include the `--open` switch for `trunk serve`, which will automatically open the frontend in your browser
